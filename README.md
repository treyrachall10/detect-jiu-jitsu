# Detect Jiu-Jitsu

This project explores different ways to consistently classify and detect people during jiu-jitsu rolls.

The goal is to build a flexible system where models can be easily swapped in or out (“plug and play”). While the structure supports multiple models, not all are fully integrated or functional yet.

Parameters for models are not final. The project also aims to allow for parameter tweaking to see what parameters present the best results for jiu-jitsu environments.

More updates and improvements coming soon.
